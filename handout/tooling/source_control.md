# Source Control: [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

A source control, sometimes called a version control brings change management to saving files at different points in the development process. A **Version control system (VCS)** that will we make use of is _Git_.

Git is a decentralized distributed versioning system, it allows programmers to collaborate on the same codebase without stepping on each other's toes.  It has become the de-facto source control system for open source development because of its decentralized model and cheap branching features.
