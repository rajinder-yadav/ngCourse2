## Web Browser

We use Google's Chrome browser for this course because of its cutting-edge JavaScript engine and excellent debugging tools.

Some who champion the freedom of the 'Open Free Internet' use Mozilla Firefox, there is a [Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) available with development and debugging tools. However, code written with JavaScript should work on any modern web browser (Firefox, IE9+, Chrome, Safari, Opera).
