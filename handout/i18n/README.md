## What is the purpose of i18n?

Internationalization (or *i18n*, which stands for *i-<eighteen letters>-n*) is the process of adapting software and web applications to multiple languages, allowing their application to be used by multiple language-speaking users. By ensuring that your application supports multiple languages, you can reach a broader audience and ensure a smooth user experience for multilingual users.
